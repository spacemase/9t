    <h1>About</h1>
    This is the end of the revolution.<br />
    <br />
    9 Thermidor, Year II in the French Republican Calendar represented the end of the Reign of Terror and the end of the bloodiest excesses of the French Revolution. Maximilien Robespierre and what was left of his associates were arrested (they were condemned and guillotined on 10 Thermidor, without trial), and a more conservative regime was instituted. I can imagine them lauding themselves for the improvement in their numbers: only several hundred guillotined in the next couple of years, an improvement over 1300 in Robespierre&#39;s six weeks (he was efficient, was a disciple of Rousseau, was nicknamed "The Incorruptible").<br />
    <br />
    This isn&#39;t to say we condone Thermidorian Reactions in general, or the chopping off of anybody&#39;s head. What we believe in is the creation of new calendars from arbitrary ingredients, the dissolution of one revolution before another, new names for everything, the burial of all new conventions.<br />
    <br />
    In honor of the downfall of a tyrant, Nine Thermidor promotes collaborations in literature and art. In honor of the spirit of revolution and revolt, we seek out and celebrate what is new, unusual, exciting and beautiful, things that occur when one thing ends and another is just about to begin.<br />

      <div class="writerInfo">
        <strong>Do you hate or dislike more than three people?</strong><br />
        A: I dislike more than three people in this room.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>What occupation do you find sexy?</strong><br />

        <strong>What do you want done with your body when you die?</strong><br />
        A: The doctors inform me I have only months to live due to an inoperable brain tumor (obviously). After a twenty-minute Rube Goldberg spectacle, the rope holding the guillotine blade above my neck burns through and the blade falls, projecting my head into a basket, which I have woven myself ahead of time, under water. Both the basket and my body are placed on a raft by my adoring fans. Then, the archers line up. With lit arrows they shoot at the raft as it jettisons off into the water, burning my remains, which are then collected and sent to the <a href="http://www.lifegem.com/">LifeGem</a> laboratory to be made into diamonds. The diamonds are sent to Damian Hirst, who installs them in a sculpture, which is displayed in the Tate Modern in perpetuity.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Who sits behind you in math class?</strong><br />
        A: My brother, because he&#39;s older and dumber.<br />
