    <h2>WHAT IS A POX PARTY</h2>
    In the spring when you are six one of the kids in your kindergarten class comes down with chicken pox, so his mother puts a sign on the bulletin board and a few days later you are in the back of the car on your way to the pox party. You don&#39;t want to go because the last time you saw Vincent he got you in trouble for eating paste (which you did not do) and later for pushing someone over on the playground (which you did), but your mom is making you go anyway. She looks at you in the rear-view mirror with a mixture of ruthlessness and guilt. You can only see her eyes.<br /><br />
    When you get there your mom tells you to give Vincent a hug and then she goes into the kitchen with the grown-ups. Vincent is wrapped up in a blanket on the couch. He opens his eyes occasionally, and occasionally he scratches at himself, but otherwise he isn&#39;t much more than a piece of furniture in the room, a television set or a strangely-carved box, another object to touch or look at. You sit on a chair pushed back in the far corner behind a tall, leafy plant, and you swing your legs awkwardly. You are the biggest kid in your class, which makes you nervous. So does your new green velvet party dress. You aren&#39;t sure if you like how it feels when you move your hands back and forth across it.<br /><br />
    The others have all gathered around Vincent. They murmur to each other and place their fingers on his spots. They can already feel something starting to grow and multiply inside themselves. Vincent opens and closes his eyes. You can feel it, too. You can feel it in your blood.<br /><br />
    <h2>THEREFORE THIS IS OUR INTENTION</h2>
    We intend to invite you to our own pox party, and by invite I mean it&#39;s for your own good and you are going whether you like it or not now get in the car.<br />
    We intend to inoculate you with our words and pictures, noises and gestures, and with the words, pictures, noises and gestures of some people you may not know but probably should.<br />
    We intend to plant the virus for your body to rebel against.<br />
    We intend a cure for the poetry that cures what ails you<br />
    We intend you to come upon these things unexpectedly and delightedly.<br />
    We intend you sometimes to come upon these things with disgust.<br />
    We intend to declare loudly our intentions and our opinions and to encourage you to do the same.<br />
    <br />
    <h2>TO THIS END</h2>
    Over the past couple of months we have been collecting manifestos, from our friends, our neighbors, from people we have met in dark bars on sunny afternoons. This is the response.<br />
