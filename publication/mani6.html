<h2>Nicholas Davis - From The Half Clutch To The Crutch</h2><br>


No, it won’t be<br>
<br>
The bejeweled tools<br>
<br>
That set one free.<br>
<br>
And it won’t be<br>
<br>
Akin to any Luxury.<br>
<br>
Because even when one sleeps,<br>
<br>
Clutching the diamond-eyed teddy bears<br>
<br>
And nearly extinct furs,<br>
<br>
It is the dreams that occur.<br>
(This is the way)<br>
More so when one has only just awoken.<br>
<br>
This moment of Lucid ignition.<br>
<br>
Half-opened eyes widening with realization,<br>
<br>
As the unconvicted, conveniently-lazied bombs<br>
<br>
Explode.<br>
<br>
Taking with them all the priceless crutches<br>
<br>
On the perpetual pilgrimage<br>
<br>
To the Matter Recycling Factory.<br>
<br>
But with a frantic jolt,<br>
<br>
It will all rewind<br>
<br>
To the very first day.<br>
<br>
Where once again<br>
(And again)<br>
One may bathe<br>
<br>
In the Simpson and Seinfeld repeats,<br>
<br>
Rinsing all the dream-colored waters out of the soul,<br>
<br>
Sending them<br>
<br>
Back to<br>
<br>
From whence they came.<br>
<br>
