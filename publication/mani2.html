As an artist, I am redefining "environmentalism." Currently the term describes a human-serving, not environmental-serving idea. Environmentalists clean up the earth for their/our own gratification. We struggle to maintain ecosystems so we will have food to eat, water to drink, and beautiful places to drive our bio-diesel cars to visit. The environment, clean or no, exists for human consumption. What if we were forced to think of the earth, and all its creatures, as equals to humanity? <br><br>

I use visual, public and interactive art to extend civil equality to nature. I build environments in which man and nature are tolerant, accepting, even embracing of each other. I plant gardens sanctioned for the growing of "weeds." I encourage plants to grow between the floorboards and window seams of abandoned buildings.  I forge bronze monuments to the tiniest miracles of spring. I seek to dissolve the boundary between man and nature, pushing them so far together that they cease to exist as separate entities.<br><br>

We may think we've conquered nature, shutting it outside our climate-controlled shelters and giving it a new name. I fear the consequences of making the earth our enemy instead of our home. Sharing my vision of an alternate future renews my hope.<br>
