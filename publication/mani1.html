<h2>9 Manifestos</h2><br>
1.<br>
these are our intentions: to eliminate once & for all the distance between us, to redraw the perimeters or to do away with them altogether, to reinstitute the use of the plural first person in every sentence. we also intend: more haiku on the brick walls of alleyways. more impromptu whitman readings in the stairways of old apartment buildings and of new glass office towers. we intend: more running with eyes shut, more reworkings and upheavals of old forms, more pictures and textures in our books.<br>

we have remembered the importance of a feather spiraling to the ground, describing the same shape in the air as a maple-seed helicopter does. everything that has ever happened to us in our lives has happened in the basement apartments of strangers. we are interested in insects, but we wouldn't say exclusively. our horoscope is always wrong. when we were eleven we believed in logic, good grades, and revolution. everything is important. 
<br><br>

after a dream that lasted all night, we have decided to blast away perimeters after all. in this world there are no borders. there are no countries. there is only the infinite variety of being human, without the need to believe otherwise. in this world there is no fear of infinity. we have learned infinity is not frightening. it implies connection and freedom and beauty. we want you to know you can call us any time of night when you wake up afraid of everything. infinity doesn't need to mean isolation.

i was eating a beignet in the back seat of my friend's car. we were driving my sister to the airport. it was sunny and there was traffic downtown and my sister kept turning around and grinning and holding her cigarette out the window. her suitcase was on the seat next to me, and i think it also glowed. when i looked outside i saw a white seagull feather falling to the ground by the mailboxes—not drifting but plunging, spinning tip-first to the sidewalk. i didn't know feathers could fall that way. i think my fingertips were glowing.

i think we may be confusing obsolete technology and defunct pop culture with personal history or generational identity. we may be romanticizing too much the typewriter and the postage stamp. i am not going to stop. we may be the generation best able to bring together old and new technology to create new forms, to break apart old forms and put them back together in beautiful ways. we have plenty to do. i hope you know i am excited for us, but please understand if i don't want to talk about which was my favorite ninja turtle.

i was in the back yard, trying to mow the lawn i'd let get too long again. i was shoving the rusty push-mower over the same patch of two-foot grass over and over. outside the knot-holes in the thin tall fence bums passed by, and somewhere eight or nine dogs were barking. probably at that house that always has a column of smoke rising from the back yard, and radio folk music, and men chopping wood in the alley just behind it. i pressed my hair against my face and gave the lawn a couple more swipes.

we believe in loneliness. we believe in independence, and that doesn't come without loneliness. we believe in art as a product of loneliness and as a weapon against it. we believe loneliness is the main driving factor in everything that happens in the world. it lies beneath greed and fear, and although countries are a defense against it, we think there are better defenses that don't involve murder or deception or humiliation. remember how your mother smiled and made you hot chocolate and was infected by your excitement that snow day when you were ten. 
<br><br>

further, we intend: the hectic, crazy, passionate creation of things. we intend for there to be more music, more light, more energy, more poetry, more noise and color and art than we can handle.

out the window of the bus i saw a man and a woman sitting at a table in front of a coffee shop. they were playing cards. they took turns setting cards down and every once in a while i could see the mouth of one or the other form a word. the woman played a card and suddenly the man exploded in laughter. i couldn't hear, but his mouth went wide, his eyes shut and he rocked back and forward. and he drew card after card after card from the pile.
