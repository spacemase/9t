<h2>Francesca Davidson - The Love You Take is Equal to the Love You Make</h2><br>

You can never really claim what is not of your own creation.<br>
 <br>
You may take it.<br>
hold it.<br>
hear it.<br>
feel it.<br>
But you can not know it.<br>
understand it.<br>
own it.<br>
 <br>

The light of the world is contained in a glass of prosecco.<br>
Take it in your hand,<br>
hold it up to the afternoon sun,<br>
and see life in the amber crystals dancing in the bowl,<br>
 <br>
But until you take it in the mouth,<br>
it can not exist for you.<br>
Until your eyes swell and head sways<br>
and the wine becomes you,<br>
You can not know it.<br>
 <br>
The light of the world is in the pitch of a child's laughter.<br>
Hear it in the hitch,<br>
see it in the full-upper-mouth-grin,<br>
the crooked baby teeth.<br>
 <br>
But unless you provoked it,<br>
inspired it.<br>
You can not understand it.<br>
 <br>
The light of the world resides along the edge of a collar bone,<br>
of a woman in a shadowed room.<br>
The moon glows upon her left shoulder<br>
and the small concave place below her neck.<br>
You may feel it in your longing,<br>
see it in the soft beauty of the room,<br>
 <br>
But until you have rested your cheek there,<br>
and felt the subtle movement it makes,<br>
as she quietly gasps then exhales,<br>
You can not own it.<br>
 <br>
In this world and any other,<br>
all lack comes from that which is kept at a distance,<br>
all that is had has simply been sought out.<br>
