<h2>Austin Miller</h2><br>

I stole this manifesto from someone else and changed all the words. These things are all over the place. Who would really ever even care?<br>
 <br>
That would be awkward if he read this wouldn't it?<br>
 <br>
But now I wonder if in all my apathy, insensitivity, and lethargy have I ever had reason for a manifesto. Have I ever held an opinion so high that I must make it publically known? To create an idea so thought out that I could write directions for the accustomed populous? The answer; overtly no.<br>
 <br>
I am an individual in a sea of originality, I am the routine.<br>
 <br>
It began in school, when the teachers would say, "He isn't stupid, he just doesn’t try". I could have wrote your essay, but drawing was more fun.<br>
 <br>
Parents get mad, but don't they always?<br>
 <br>
Now I work a nine to five, or a four to midnight, and sometimes a twelve to eight. I've listened to the teachers, the family, and my friends and now I think I'm smarter because I find everything boring.<br>
 <br>
Drugs would probably help.<br>
 <br>
Then one day I made a discovery: an unopened can of beer! Right there in the refrigerator next to the apples. I don’t remember buying it, so I hope I didn't steal it. It's okay, the guy was probably an asshole anyway. That beer though....<br>
 <br>
Chances are I drink too much.<br>
 <br>
But damn it Bill W. this is my world and it is bland. So I think I will drink that beer. It's a comfort from that routine and it makes me feel better about all the individuals with ambition, ideas, and most importantly manifestos.<br>
 <br>
My name is Austin and I never feared plagiarism. Fuck you Lloyd Blankenship, I don't think this was a manifesto at all..<br>
