<h2>Chris Wrayton</h2>
<br>
Be deliberate and do one thing well;<br>
Be delicate. Live, find and create balance;<br>
Be quiet, so you may learn to listen;<br>
Be the habit that changes daily;<br>
And be the chaos among order.<br>
<br>
James Bond is a jack of all trades, you are not.<br>
Should someone step on your toes, you do not step back.<br>
<br>
Create works of quality, not quantity. Most youtube links cry wolf.<br>
<br>
Learn something new every day. Love yourself today more than you might have loved yourself<br> yesterday. Forgive yourself if you know you're at least changing.<br>
<br>
But do not rebel with the tools they have given you!<br>
Do not be the millionth daft, blase, and standout youth!<br>
Do not block the sidewalks and cafe doors with your self-righteousness!<br>
<br>
Because we all know there's really no such thing as original, or authentic.<br>
There is only the cow, and the big mac.<br>
Be the cow and think nothing of it.<br>
