Flatchestedmama embraces gray</div></div>

<p>Gray is not associated with a bloom. As a mental state, it's
indecisive. As an emotion, it calls for pharmaceuticals. If it were a
building, no rocks would be hurled at its windows, but neither would
they be cleaned. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/08/arts/design/08john.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin">Jasper Johns, the ice man of contemporary art, made it work for him</a>, but few have followed his lead, outside of the Northwest.</p>
<p>Naturally enough, given the weather, gray is historically big with
regional painters. Local performance artists haven't shown much
interest, however, till now. Along with photos of her day at the beach,
<a href="http://www.flatchestedmama.com/">Amy-Ellen "Flatchestedmama" Trefsger</a> is giving gray a go in a performance at <a href="http://greygalleryandlounge.com/index.old.html">Grey Gallery and Lounge</a> on Capitol Hill. </p>
<p>Her plan is gray on gray in Grey: <b>I'll be holding Color Court on
Saturday, May 17th, 4:00 p.m. at Grey Gallery and Lounge: 1512 11th Ave
Seattle, WA 98122. For those of you who don't know, I am currently in
the midst of my 2nd Monochromatic May, where I wear nothing but grey
clothing for the month (underclothing and accessories included). Color
Court is a way for you, the viewer, to participate in what is allowed
in my wardrobe. To date, 3-4 items from the wardrobe have been disputed
by the general public with statements like, "that scarf looks
blue/grey" or, "there's too much white in those shoes." All items that
receive any color dispute are up for review at Color Court. If the
items are found to be in Contempt of Color Court (by majority vote)
they will be placed in the Color Corrections bin and not be worn again.
Your Clerks of Color Court will be the lovely Amanda Mae and Darla Rae
Barry Benson.</b></p>
<p>My story on her marriage to herself is <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/visualart/191312_marry18.html">here</a>. Her work might sound like pompous nonsense, but it grows on you. As G.I. Joe likes to say, "Resistance is futile!"</p>
