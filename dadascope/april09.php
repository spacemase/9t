    <div class="dadaLabelLeft">January</div>
    <em>Fledgling</em> is Octavia Butler&#39;s foray into vampire fiction, and unlike the Rice books with their homoeroticism, the <em>Underworld</em> films with their vampires vs. lycans dichotomy, and the <em>Twilight</em> books with their teen vampire angle, this book considers the unique symbiotic relationship between blood suckers and their source of food.  Instead of weak victims, these symbionts are willing participants to the vampirism, and as a reward they live very long healthy lives.  Stray Dog, if you have an unusual relationship that might not make sense from an outsider&#39;s perspective, perhaps you should carefully weigh your benefits before jumping to hasty conclusions.

    I wonder if one can live quite comfortably when one&#39;s conscious of the disapproval of one&#39;s fellows?  Are you sure it won&#39;t begin to worry you?  Everyone has some sort of conscience, and sooner or later it will find you out.  Supposing your wife died, wouldn&#39;t you be tortured by remorse?  He did not answer, and I waited for some time for him to speak.  At last I had to break the silence myself.<br />
    What have you to say to that?<br />
    Only that you&#39;re a damned fool.<br />
    <br />
    (W. Somerset Maughan&#39;s <em>The Moon and Sixpence</em>)

    Assemblage and collage represent distinctly modern artistic strategies that reflect the 20th century experience of a cultural landscape densely cluttered with signs, commodities, and urban detritus.  Juxtaposition was important to Surrealist Europeans, New York based artists like Joseph Cornell, and the post-war West Coast artists like Wallace Berman who put out an art publication called SEMINA, an envelope filled with drawings, prints and poems from collaborating artists.  Theoretically, the reader assembles the disparate pieces into a meaningful array, building associations and narrative.  This month I encourage you to let go of the notion of a linear cohesion within your own life, and try to embrace the chaotic nature of this random world.

    In Japan, a nation ravaged by atomic bombings, they celebrate Peace Day on November 3rd, while here in the US we celebrate Memorial Day, Veteran&#39;s Day, and Independence Day to honor our war filled past.  WTF!

    <div class="dadaLabelLeft">May</div>
    Samuel Beckett&#39;s <em>Endgame</em> is a mournful tale of eldercare that reminds us that we all die alone, and many of us will paradoxically care for our parents as our own children someday.  With this thought in mind, Ant, embrace your elders around you: open a few doors, give up your seat on the bus, or call your mother just to tell her thank you.

    <div class="dadaLabelLeft">June</div>
    In the late autumn, the Gregorian calendar promises a new year soon. All of the rot and decay become bearable with the abstract clean slate around the corner.  Now in the spring, all this reawakening and burgeoning growth should be welcomed with open arms, yet the new life taking root is frightening, as is the idea of leaving the nest.  Somewhere an academic is receiving an acceptance letter to the graduate program of her choice, and is terribly frightened of what lies in wait.  There is no danger for us, and there is no safety.<br />
    <br />
    (TS Eliot)

    Ernest Hemingway believed that writers should write the true sentence, write the truest thing they can. Hemingway gave this advice to F. Scott Fitzgerald, who worried about the commercial success of his work.  Fitzgerald was attempting to formulate work around an audience and its desires, and yet he had already written some of his best work.  He had already published <em>The Great Gatsby</em>, as well as <em>The Diamond as Big as the Ritz</em> and <em>The Ice Palace</em>, both fantastic pieces of short fiction, which I implore you to run out and read right now.  Sadly, audiences were slow to appreciate the fine caliber of Fitzgerald&#39;s work, and he nihilistically ended his life one drink at a time, dying in 1940 at the age of 44.  Take this to heart, Seagull. While your ideas and actions may not be appreciated by your contemporaries, fear not as they will all come around.

    <div class="dadaLabelLeft">August</div>
    William Carlos Williams wrote in <em>January Morning</em> of the beauty of travels being attributed to the time of day sites are seen.  As travelers we keep certain hours, ambitious or lazy; the world is glimpsed briskly or leisurely, but in a differing light from our daily work week schedules. This month, Crow, I hope that you can try to perceive your mundane existence with your traveler&#39;s eyes, waking earlier or staying up later to enjoy your home town in its entire luster.  Treat yourself to a tourist attraction at the end of a long day. Ride the monorail. Eat a gelato outdoors.

    Petit the Poet<br />
    <br />
    Seeds in a dry pod, tick, tick, tick,<br />
    Tick, tick, tick, like mites in a quarrel<br />
    Faint iambics that the full breeze wakens<br />
    But the pine tree makes a symphony thereof.<br />
    Triolets, villanelles, rondels, rondeaus,<br />
    Ballades by the score with the same old thought:<br />
    The snows and the roses of yesterday are vanished;<br />
    And what is love but a rose that fades?<br />
    Life all around me here in the village:<br />
    Tragedy, comedy, valor and truth,<br />
    Courage, constancy, heroism, failure<br />
    All in the loom and oh what patterns!<br />
    Woodlands, meadows, streams and rivers<br />
    Blind to all of it all my life long.<br />
    Triolets, villanelles, rondels, rondeaus,<br />
    Seeds in a dry pod, tick, tick, tick,<br />
    Tick, tick, tick, what little iambics,<br />
    While Homer and Whitman roared in the pines?<br />
    <br />
    (Edgar Lee Masters&#39; <em>Spoon River Anthology</em>)

    There had been a doorbell once, but it had broken and stopped ringing even before the doctor had been captured by the partisans.  He was about to knock when he noticed that there was now a padlock on the door, hanging from two rings roughly screwed into the old oak panels with their fine carving, which in places had come away.  Such destructiveness would have been inconceivable in the old days.  There would have been a fitted lock, and if it had been out of order there would have been locksmiths to repair it.  This trifling detail was eloquent of the general deterioration of things, which had gone a great deal further in his absence.<br />
    <br />
    (Boris Pasternak&#39;s <em>Doctor Zhivago</em>)

    In Oscar Wilde&#39;s play <em>An Ideal Husband</em>, a character states, A man&#39;s life is of more value than a woman&#39;s.  It has larger issues, wider scope, greater ambitions.  A woman&#39;s life revolves in curves of emotions.  It is upon lines of intellect that a man&#39;s life progresses a woman who can keep a man&#39;s love and love him in return has done all the world wants of women, or should want of them.  Wilde wrote these words, but they did not reflect his own sentiment.  Wilde was invited to edit The Woman&#39;s World, a Victorian fashion magazine, due to his progressive views on feminism.  This month, be sure to consider the context.
