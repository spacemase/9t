      In <em>Difference and Repetition</em>, Gilles Deleuze outlines a philosophy in which we can seek to re-intensify the patterns that give consistency to out actual lives.  We should vary our lives so that they express all deep intensities or differences in themselves (connect with everything).  But we know that the abstraction of habit and memory mitigate against the emergence of new sensations and hence against the expression of virtual intensities and ideas, so do not make your variation depend on representation, habit and memory. Leave all actual things behind (forget everything).

      In a passage near the beginning of the fifth volume of <em>In Search of Lost Time</em>, Proust warns against the danger of falling into an apathy created by getting lost in the quagmire of endless possibilities. "This helps one to understand the human heart," he says, "but one is apt to be taken in by individuals." He knows his girlfriend is unfaithful, but rather than going with her when she goes out, he lies to her and tells her his doctor has ordered him to stay at home, where he can obsess over all the things she might be doing with other men when he&#39;s not around. This month, Cockroach, don&#39;t let your mind paralyze you, but take action. "Now there may occur in the lives of men and of nations... a moment when we need to have within us a chief of police, a clear-sighted diplomat, a master-detective, who instead of pondering over the possible contingencies that extend to all the points of the compass, reasons soundly."

      In <em>Moby Dick</em>, Melville writes at length on the misunderstood nature of whaling, society may consider the harpooneer and the whaler to be little more than vile butchers, but this oversimplification misses the poeticism of the life spent on the rolling ocean, the hunt and chase, the exoticism of foreign ports.  Have you been feeling underappreciated in your own vocation lately?  Perhaps you should write a long, dense novel about your trade which few will finish reading but which will eventually find its way into the recognized canon.

      "He informed me that he and I would be alone, besides the nurse on duty. On principle, the residents of the Home weren&#39;t allowed to attend the funerals. He only allowed them to go to the wake. &#39;It&#39;s a matter of humanity,&#39; he said."  This is an excerpt from the novel <em>The Stranger</em> by Albert Camus. I hear there is also a free weekly in Seattle called "The Stranger." PICK ONE.

      This month the mysteries of the Dadascope have directed us to open to a story entitled "In the Village" by the poet Elizabeth Bishop. This brings to mind two things. First, I have just today received (finally!) a book I placed a hold on at the public library months and months ago, <em>Words in Air</em>, a collection of letters between Elizabeth Bishop and Robert Lowell. Why is everyone so excited to read the letters of a couple of poets, but not excited enough to actually buy the book? Well it&#39;s $45. You can get a lot of candy for $45. Second, the title: "In the Village." In the opening lines of the introduction for the 1967 television show, <em>The Prisoner</em>, Number 6 asks "Where am I?" The response is: "In the Village." It seems unlikely that all of this is mere coincidence.

      In the third volume of Proust&#39;s novel, M. de Charlus is surrounded by servants who bicker among themselves over the honor of bringing their master his nightshirt or a candlestick. Somehow they have come to believe there is no greater joy than to serve him. Be careful right now of letting yourself fall into a similar trap. Your employer is not your god. I suspect, Pigeon, that this might even be the time for some sort of personal proletariat revolution.

      <pre>For Grace, After a Party

You do not always know what I am feeling
Last night in the warm spring air while I was
Blazing my tirade against someone who doesn&#39;t interest
        me, it was love for you that set me 
afire,
        and isn&#39;t it odd? For in rooms full of
strangers my most tender feelings
					writhe and
bear the fruit of screaming. Put out your hand,
isn&#39;t there
	an ashtray, suddenly, there? beside
the bed? And someone you love enters the room
and says wouldn&#39;t
		you like the eggs a little
different today?
		And when they arrive they are
Just plain scrambled eggs and the warm weather
Is holding.

      Most artists do not daydream about <em>making</em> great art, they daydream about <em>having made</em> great art.  This month, Crow, I implore you to pick up a piece of chalk and draw on a public wall.  This drawing should be a manifesto of your commitment to produce things, a promise to yourself and to others of greatness to come.

      According to Thomas P. Hughs, University of Pennsylvania professor and visiting professor at MIT, "while environmentalists are deeply concerned about the natural world, we should also seek ways in which we can make the human-built world more sustainable and supportive of the quality of human life.  We should... direct attention to the ecotechnological environment in which we mostly live, systems in which the natural and human-built overlap and interact."<br />

      Mock turtle soup is like turtle soup but made out of the feet and the head of the lamb.  There really is no such animal as a mock turtle.  Like there is no animal called the nog, which appears in egg nog despite my best efforts to confuse my little sister.

      Of beast, bird, fish, serpent &amp; element,<br />
      Combustion, blast, vapour and cloud
